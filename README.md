# Turf Wars

Turf Wars is a competitive multiplayer game on Roblox inspired by the classic Minecraft mini-game. Players engage in rounds that alternate between building and combat phases, using a **Slingshot** to fire projectiles and a **Hammer** to build and destroy blocks.

## Features
- **Round System**: Controlled by a singleton `RoundManager`, managing multiple phases (build phase, combat phase, etc.).
- **Grid-Based Building System**: Players can place and destroy blocks strategically.
- **Tool System**: Implemented with the `ToolComponent` class and child classes `SlingshotComponent` and `HammerComponent`.
- **Flamework Framework**: Utilized for structured and modular development.
- **TypeScript & Roblox-TS**: Used for improved maintainability and scalability.

## Development
- **Client-Side & Server-Side Systems**: Separate classes handle game logic efficiently.
- **Open Source**: The full source code is available on GitHub.

## Future Plans
- Improved animations and effects.
- Additional game modes.
- Expanded customization options.
